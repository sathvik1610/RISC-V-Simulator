# 🖥️ RISC-V Simulator

## Overview

This project is a basic simulator for the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**, implemented in **C++**. It is designed to help students, educators, and developers understand how RISC-V instructions are executed at a low level.

## Project Phases

The development of this simulator was carried out in three distinct phases. Detailed documentation for each phase can be found below:

* 📄 [Phase 1](Phase1.pdf) 
* 📄 [Phase 2](Phase2.pdf)  
* 📄 [Phase 3](Phase3.pdf)  

## ⚠️ Note

> Some RISC-V instructions are **not yet implemented**. However, equivalent functionality can typically be achieved using alternative supported instructions.
